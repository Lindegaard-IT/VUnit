# VUnit

## Introduction

This is intended to be a library for writing unit tests in a way that resembles xUnit (in as much as it can).

### Credits

This project is inspired by xUnit, after using those in Java and C# it seemed like having something _similar_ for Vala might be a good idea. 

The project here is inspired by the work of Michael Gratton, for testing the Geary mail client from the Gnome project. The code for this can be found here:

## Usage

This section will be littered with examples later...
